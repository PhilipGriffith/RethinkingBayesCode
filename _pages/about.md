Richard McElreath's _Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan_ is a dangerous book, for it not only explains Bayesian inference in an interesting and cogent way, but also convinces you that, just perhaps, with enough courage and enough practice, you too can fashion golems from the digital clay.

Under its spell, I decided that, rather than make good use of the many excellent internet resources in R that guide the intrepid novice through each set of the book's practice problems, I would instead use Python to solve the practice problems and in so doing teach myself the PyMC3 library. I realize now this is akin to learning Hebrew by studying Kabbalah, and though Malkuth may be in Kether, it's been slow going.

The reason for this is simple. While the many code examples that run throughout _Statistical Rethinking_ have been converted from R into Python by the talented developers of PyMC3 (an invaluable asset when making your way through the main text), when it comes to working through the exercises at the end of each chapter, Python code solutions only exist for half of the practice problems, and almost all of those lie in the last half of the book. With no clear path between chapter two and chapter ten, there is a marked decline in the pace of hands-on Python practice for a beginner like me.

This website is my attempt to trace a path through the middle of the book, both for others who may find it useful and for my future self who certainly will. The site contains an entry for every chapter of the book; each entry contains both an overview of the chapter sections as well as solutions in Python for every exercise. Any and all errors are my own.

I am indebted to the work of others much abler than I for both the form and content of many of these solutions. In particular, the code created by the developers at PyMC3 and the insightful blog posts by Jeffrey Girard have served as ever-helpful guides while finding my way.
