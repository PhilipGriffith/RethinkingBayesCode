Easy.
4E1. In the model definition below, which line is the likelihood?
yi ∼ Normal(µ, σ)
µ ∼ Normal(0, 10)
σ ∼ Exponential(1)
4E2. In the model definition just above, how many parameters are in the posterior distribution?124 4. GEOCENTRIC MODELS
4E3. Using the model definition above, write down the appropriate form of Bayes’ theorem that
includes the proper likelihood and priors.
4E4. In the model definition below, which line is the linear model?
yi `tilde` Normal(µ, σ)
µi = α + βxi
α `tilde` Normal(0, 10)
β `tilde` Normal(0, 1)
σ `tilde` Exponential(2)
4E5. In the model definition just above, how many parameters are in the posterior distribution?
