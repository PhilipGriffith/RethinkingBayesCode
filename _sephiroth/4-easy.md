# Easy.

**4E1.** In the model definition below, which line is the likelihood?

$$\begin{align}
y_i &\sim Normal(\mu, \sigma) \\
\mu &\sim Normal(0, 10) \\
\sigma &\sim Uniform(0, 10)
\end{align}$$

<hr>

**4E2.** In the model definition just above, how many parameters are in the posterior distribution?

<hr>

**4E3.** Using the model definition above, write down the appropriate form of Bayesâ€™ theorem that includes the proper likelihood and priors.

<hr>

**4E4.** In the model definition below, which line is the linear model?

$$\begin{align}
y_i &\sim Normal(\mu, \sigma) \\
\mu_i &= \alpha + \beta x_i \\
\alpha &\sim Normal(0, 10) \\
\beta &\sim Normal(0, 1) \\
\sigma &\sim Uniform(0, 10)
\end{align}$$

**4E5.** In the model definition just above, how many parameters are in the posterior distribution?
